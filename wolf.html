    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
        Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the
        animal lupus (*lúkʷos). The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.

        Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their
        names. Examples include<br> Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"),<br> Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"),<br> Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"),<br> Wulfheard
        ("Wolf-hard"),<br> Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"),<br> Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone"),<br> Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"),<br> Wolfhroc
        ("Wolf-Frock"),<br> Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"),<br> Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"),<br> Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait")<br> and Wolfdregil ("Wolf
        Runner").

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
        In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the binomial
        nomenclature. Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog", and under this genus he listed the doglike
        carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris, and
        the wolf as Canis lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its
        "cauda recurvata" (upturning tail) which is not found in any other canid.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae family, and is further distinguished from coyotes and
        jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail. It is slender and
        powerfully built, with a large, deeply descending rib cage, a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck. The
        wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to
        overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter. The ears are relatively small
        and triangular. The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt
        muzzle. The skull is 230-280 mm (9-11 in) in length and 130-150 mm (5-6 in) in width. The teeth are
        heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. They are not as
        specialized as those found in hyenas though. Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same
        extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and
        foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.
