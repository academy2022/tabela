    <h1>Pangolin</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (/fɒlɪˈdoʊtə/, from Ancient
        Greek ϕολιδωτός – "clad in scales"). The one extant family, the Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus,
        and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species
        each, all found in sub-Saharan Africa. These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number
        of extinct pangolin species are also known.
    </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large, hardened, overlapping, plate-like scales, which are
        soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal matures. They are made of keratin, the same material
        from which human fingernails and tetrapod claws are made, and are structurally and compositionally very
        different from the scales of reptiles.
    </p>
    <h2>Poaching</h2>
    <p>
        Historically pangolins were poached primarily for bushmeat, with their scales cast aside as byproducts. Over the
        last decade, however, the price fetched for skins, scales and the whole animal in countries like Vietnam and
        China, as well as in the US, has resulted in decimated populations. All eight species of pangolin are protected
        under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the highest
        level of international law.
